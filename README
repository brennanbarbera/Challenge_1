# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, we were tasked with finding the success rates of theatre kickstarters based on their launch month and goal. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide accurate information so our client can visualize where thier Kickstarter may stand.
## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
[Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/brennanbarbera/Challenge_1/blob/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
Our analysis shows that the most successful month for theatre Kickstarters was May, and the following two months also had a high rate of succesfull projects, provided our client launched theirs withing those three months, the possibility of their project being successful is greater.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
[Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/brennanbarbera/Challenge_1/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_goals.png)
If we base it solely on the goals of Kickstater projects, the highest percentage of successful projects, in relation to the number of prejects with the ranges, would $1000 to $4999. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge we faced was making sure the formatting on some of the functions was correct. However the biggest difficultly was that the graph for the "Outcomes Based on Goals" graph looked different than the one shown within the challenge guide. We attempted to remake the graph and chart from the beginning, but it still came out looking different. One theory we had was that some of the data had been deleted from the main source of data, but we concluded that if that were the case, the Outcomes Based on Launch graph would have looked different, but it was accurate. There may have been further formatting error that we overlooked. This is clearly shown in the ranges of 40000 to greater than 50000. Upon filtering those options withing the main dataset there were approximately 6 in the range of 40000 to 49999, and 4 more in greater than 50000. Check other categories there were other issues as well, but I was unsure of what was causing them.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
If Louise's Kickstatert launched in May, June, or July, it would more likely get funded. She should not start it in December based on the analysis, as success and failure rates for taht time period were almost equal.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Provided Louise's Kickstarter was launched witha goal less than $5000, the chances of it being successful are very high.   
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are more factors than just simply Goals and Launch Month to possibly consider, despite those possibly being larger factors. There is also no record of any social media outreach, even if it were just a count of locations advertised to.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Perhaps a trend of successdul and failed Kickstarters by year, see if it was trending downwards recently, or if it were on an upswing. One could look at the number of backers, compared to goal and outcome.
